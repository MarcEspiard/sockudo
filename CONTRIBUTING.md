# Contributing to Sockudo 🚀

Welcome! 🎉 We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to **Sockudo**, a high-performance WebSocket server built in Rust. Your support helps improve the real-time ecosystem and benefits the community.

## 🧠 Before You Start

- **Read the [README](./README.md)** for project setup and usage.
- **Check existing issues and discussions** before opening a new one.
- Contributions of *all kinds* are welcome — code, docs, tests, issues, etc.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RustNSparks/sockudo

````

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

* Copy and edit the example `.env` file:

  ```bash

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### ✅ Good First Tasks

* Fix typos or improve documentation
* Tidy up logs or improve CLI feedback
* Add test coverage to critical modules
* Enhance monitoring or error handling

### 💡 Feature Contributions

1. Open a discussion or issue before implementing large changes.
2. Write clean, idiomatic Rust code.
3. Add tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass.

---

## 🎯 Code Style & Tools

* Run `cargo fmt` before committing.
* Use `cargo clippy` to lint your code.
* Follow Rust best practices and Sockudo’s architecture (channels, adapters, services).
* Ensure your feature fits into the modular structure: `core`, `adapters`, `config`, etc.

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

To run integration tests (requires Redis, etc.):

```bash
make test
```

## 🚀 Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork this repo and create your branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-change
   ```

2. Make your changes with descriptive commit messages.

3. Push and open a PR to `main`:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-change
   ```

4. Link related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).

### 🔍 Code Review Process

All contributions go through a **code review**.
Please **do not merge your own pull requests**, even if all checks pass.
One of the maintainers will review your changes, suggest improvements if needed, and handle the merge. ✅
